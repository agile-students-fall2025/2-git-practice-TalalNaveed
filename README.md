## ðŸŽ¥ Learning Software Engineering During the Era of AI  

**Link:** [Learning Software Engineering During the Era of AI (TEDx, Raymond Fu)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4rG5GY9IlA)  

### ðŸ’¡ Why I Find It Interesting  
What stood out to me in this talk is how Raymond Fu frames the changing role of software engineers in the age of artificial intelligence. Traditionally, software development has focused on designing, writing, and maintaining code. But with AI now able to generate, review, and even optimize code, the role of an engineer is shifting. Rather than being replaced, engineers are being challenged to evolve focusing more on creativity, system design, problem-framing, and ethical responsibility.  

I find this interesting because it reflects a broader truth: software engineering has never been static. Just as the rise of high-level programming languages, open-source collaboration, and cloud infrastructure reshaped the field, AI represents another transformative wave. The talk highlights how adaptability and continuous learning arenâ€™t just nice-to-haves for developers, theyâ€™re core to staying relevant and impactful in a rapidly evolving landscape.
